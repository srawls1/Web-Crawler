# Web-Crawler

I developed this as an assignment for my networking class. This program reads through a list of urls from an input file and connects to each one via an HTTP request. It uses an HTML parser library to count the links in each of those pages. It has been tested with 500 threads crawling through 1,000,000 urls, and has achieved over 30 Mbps total download speed.
